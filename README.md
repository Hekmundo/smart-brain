# Smart Brain

A fun React app that allows users to sign up and begin detecting faces in the images they provide. Smart Brain will track the number of entries from a user and store their credentials in a database. AI face detection is provided and processed by [Clarifai API](https://www.clarifai.com/models/ai-face-detection).
